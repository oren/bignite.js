# bignite.js

The 'big' presentation framework + ignite style 

clone of the big project https://github.com/tmcw/big/ and added ignite style - 20 slides, 15 seconds each. 
start by hitting space.

I also added support for [bigclicker](https://github.com/tmcw/bigclicker) - controlling the slides from a mobile phone

## Using with bigclicker

    git clone https://github.com/tmcw/bigclicker.git
    cd bigclicker
    npm install
    node server.js

And access <your laptop ip>:3001 from your mobile phone. now you can move next and back with your phone.
